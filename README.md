# 2. Customer sales across 4 regions

### Overview of this project:closed_book:
This is a guided project. The questions/objectives were prepared in author's youtube video.

### Brief:closed_book:
Dataset was pulled from [here](https://github.com/stanley-george-joseph/Customer-Analysis-Tableau). This dataset contains over 280,000 records of 36 columns. In this analysis, only several columns are utilized during the process of visualizing them in Tableau namely value, total, age, region, category and month. The "customer since" column was presented with a date that was unrecognizable by excel because of format indifferences during input. Although this column was not part of the analysis, however proper cleaning needed to be done for future uses. The column was formatted into "dmy" instead of "mdy".
